# What is a Network?

A network is a system of paths traveled by any number of things, like people, cars, water, sewage, or electricity.
Roads, utility lines, streams, and plumbing/water infrastructure are commonly thought of as networks. If we think of the substance traveling through a network as a "commodity", be it people, water, etc., we can ask questions like "How long will it take for an oil spill in this river system to reach the city reservoir?" or "How long will the bus take to travel from the grocery store to the senior center?" When you ask Google Maps to create driving directions from your phone, you are performing a type of network analysis. In this example, we will use a road network, convention center, hotels, and fire stations to solve network problems.

All data files for downtown Columbia, SC in UTM meters. The feature classes that you will work with are:

*r_walk* - Transportation segements in downtown Columbia \
*firestations* - Fire stattions in downtown Columbia \
*Callcott* - Location of Callcott Building (Home of the Geography Department at USC) \
*hotels* - Hotels in South Carolina

Using network analysis, a map showing the hotels within 15 and 25 minute walking distance from the Callcott Center was created:
