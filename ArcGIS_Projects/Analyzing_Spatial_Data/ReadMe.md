# Buffering 

Buffering is a useful procedure when you want to be able to define distances from features. These can be:
-   Rings around point features (you can have multiple rings)
-   Buffers around line features
-   Buffers around polygon boundaries (inside or outside the polygons) 

Distance can be constant or variable, that is, based on an attribute value.

# Overlay Analysis

**Union**
- Considered an "OR" operator
- All information from BOTH layers is included

**Intersect**
- Considered an "AND" operator
- Only space that is shared between the two features is included
