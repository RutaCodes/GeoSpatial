# ArcGIS

ESRI® ArcGIS® is an integrated family of software products that consists of Desktop GIS, Server GIS, Mobile GIS, and Online GIS. ArcGIS technology is a platform for building a complete geographic information system (GIS) that lets you easily author data, maps, globes, and models on the desktop; publish them to a GIS server and/or share them online; and use them on the desktop, on the Web, or in the field. 

Desktop GIS is the platform for creating, editing, and analyzing geographic knowledge. It allows you to see your data on a map and analyze it to reveal patterns, relationships, and trends that are not readily apparent in tabular data, improving your decision making. Desktop GIS includes ready-to-use data and tools that let you build process models, scripts, and complete workflows to help you better answer questions, test predictions, and examine relationships in your data.

# GIS

Information system - a set of interconnected  information stored in computer databases that can be manipulated, summarized, queried, edited, and visualized.

Information System is a hierarchical infrastructure:
- Data - number, text, symbols -> database
- Information - data serving some purpose
- Evidence - multiplicity of information from different sources - problem specific

GIS (Geographic Information System) - is computer-based system that deals with geographic information. GIS software is the processing engine that deals with user interfaces, tools, and data management. 

Geographic information – information related to the Earth surface or near-surface (spatially related information):
- location and distribution
- spatial pattern: containment and adjacency
- distance
- size and scale

Key characteristics of a GISystem:
- Geographic data
- Spatial functions/analyses
- Computer-based

Vector-based systems:
- ArcGIS (ESRI, Environmental Systems Research Institute)
- GeoMedia (Intergraph)
- MapInfo (MapInfo Corp)

Raster-based systems:
- Idrisi (Clark Labs)
- IMAGINE (ERDAS)
- IDL/ENVI/ER Mapper
